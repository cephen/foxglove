# Foxglove

Hack, slash, and blast your enemies into pixels in Foxglove, a fast paced and stylish action roguelike from Bear Minimum

## Roadmap

Foxglove's development roadmap can be found [here](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNzfcjag=)

## Planned Mechanics

### Swordplay

- The primary way to fight enemies
- Good timing will deflect incoming projectiles
- [Stretch Goal] Unlock alternate melee weapons by completing challenges

### Magic [Stretch Goal]

- Spells cost Mana, which regenerates when you hit/kill enemies or deflect projectiles
- Start each run with one spell, but up to three spells can be equipped
- Randomly selected spells are placed in each level
- Mana can also be spent on an always available healing spell

### Items [Stretch Goal]

- Items provide passive effects that can drastically impact your playstyle (e.g. enemies explode on death, chance strike an enemy with lightning)
- Items are sometimes dropped by enemies, and can also be found in treasure chests

### Shops [Stretch Goal]

- Each level has a shop which buys and sells items and spells.
- Shops are protected by mercantile magic, and act as safe zones for the player.

### Enemies

- Spawn at randomised intervals until the level's boss is defeated
- Can use either melee or magic
- [Stretch Goal] Some enemies will spawn carrying an item that grants them additional effects, making them more dangerous but also more valuable
