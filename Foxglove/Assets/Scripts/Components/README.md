# Foxglove.Components

This assembly contains ECS components, which can be attached to entities
to entities at runtime to enable a variety of behaviours.

Components themselves are inert data containers, and can be thought of as column types in a database,
the actual behaviours are applied by systems (which can be found in `Assets/Scripts/Systems`)
